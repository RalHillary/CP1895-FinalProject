Hello and welcome to our Python final project! Just some notes on how to use the project:

1. You can run the application by running flask_class.py

2. Launch the application by running `python flask_class.py` and navigate to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

2. There are errors under add_player.html and update_player.html but after further research it seems to be only a
visual conflict with the flask-wtf. Apparently this is common and it doesn't affect functionality.
